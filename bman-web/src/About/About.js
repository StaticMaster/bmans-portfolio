        Hey there! I'm Isaiah, but most people know me as Bman, Ike, or Ikea.
        I've been editing for 9 years now, and it's been quite the journey. It
        all started with a group of my friends that wanted to record Fortnite,
        Rocket League, and Overwatch videos, just messing around on my phone.
        But once I got my hands on my first PC, I dove headfirst into refining
        my editing skills. Fast forward 9 years, and the progress is clear as
        day! My editing style has evolved, and I'm constantly searching for ways
        to improve and grow. But why do I actually edit tho? Well, mainly to
        support others in their content journey. Whether it's through Tikok
        shorts, Youtube Reels, etc. I want to be that person that can help
        someone who doesn't know how to maneuver around the software or those
        who struggle to execute their creative ideas. But I'm more than just a
        video editor. I'm also studying Esports Management and Business.
        Combining my passion for gaming with knowledge of the financial side of
        the gaming scene, I aim to make a meaningful impact. Through creative
        ideas with flawless execution, I hope to reach a wide audience and
        contribute to the ever-growing world of gaming and content creation.
